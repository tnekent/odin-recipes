This is a starting project I made with the aid The Odin Project.

To describe this project, it will be a simple website that links to a few recipes (this is what TOP says, I don't actually have an idea how this will go for now)

By the end of completing this project, I expect that I will have gained experience of making a basic website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript and I can proceed, with this learned skills, to making much more complex websites and learning frameworks such as React
